# uv-Global
A very small uv wrapper that lets you manage and use "globally" installed uv-projects as if they were conda environments

# How does it work?

# Installation
Obviously needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then run 
```
./install.sh
```
which appends a source command for this directory to your .bashrc in home.
